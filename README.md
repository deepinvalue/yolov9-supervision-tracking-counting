# Detection, Tracking, and Counting with YOLOv9 and Supervision

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that offers an introduction to implementing object detection, tracking, and counting using [YOLOv9](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9) and [Supervision](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision). Given that YOLOv9 has been released very recently, we are in the exciting early stages of exploring its capabilities and limitations. Please note that as the model and its ecosystem are still being refined, you might encounter some bugs. I aim to keep the code updated with the latest advancements and workarounds.
